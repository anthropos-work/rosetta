# `/demo-up` — the defaults contract

**The enumerated list of every knob and flag that controls a demo bring-up, with its real default and the
exact line that reads it.** Before v2.3 M220 no such contract existed anywhere in the corpus: the only
complete knob list was a **skill `argument-hint`** — one line of prose, never checked against any parser.

This page is **derived from the parsers, not from memory**, and it is fenced by
`rosetta-extensions/stack-core/demo_knob_guard.py`, which compares it to the scripts **in both directions**:

- **docs → parser.** A knob or flag documented here that no script reads is a **FALSE PROMISE**.
- **parser → docs.** A knob or flag a script accepts that is missing here is **UNDISCOVERABLE**.

Neither check alone is enough, and the failure mode that actually shipped was the first one.

---

## ⚠️ There are TWO entry points, and they do NOT take the same flags

This is the single most important fact on this page, and conflating the two is the bug that made the contract
necessary.

| Entry point | Accepts | On an unknown argument |
|---|---|---|
| **`demo-stack/up-injected.sh`** — the **full bring-up**; what `/demo-up N` actually runs | `<N>` (positional) and **`--public-host <host>`** — *that is the entire flag surface* | **hard-errors:** `unknown argument` → **`exit 1`** (`up-injected.sh:26-27`) |
| **`demo-stack/rosetta-demo`** — the **low-level lifecycle wrapper** (`up` / `down` / `gen` / `status` …) | `--profile`, `--services`, `--ref`, `--only`, `--resolve-only`, `--fapi-host`, `--bapi-ip`, `--webhook-secret` | per-subcommand |

> **The `/demo-up` skill's `argument-hint` used to list `--public-host`, `--profile` and `--services` together,
> as if one parser took them all.** It does not. `up-injected.sh N --profile cms` **exits 1**. `--profile` and
> `--services` are `rosetta-demo` flags — reachable via `rosetta-demo up N --services "postgresql redis"`, which
> brings up a **subset of containers without the full bring-up** (no set-dress, no seed, no cockpit).
>
> Everything else — stories, UI, set-dress, local content, certs, patches — is toggled by an **environment
> variable**, never a flag. That is why the table below is mostly env knobs.

## Env knobs — all 25

`0` = feature ON (the knob is an **opt-out**); `1` = disable it. Read the `DEMO_NO_*` names as *"do not…"*.

### Content & seeding

| Knob | Default | Effect at default | Read at |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEMO_STORIES` | `1` | **Stories & Heroes seed is ON.** Seeds the **3-org** roster (Cervato Systems / Solvantis / Northwind Aviation), each with a thriving/struggling/manager hero trio | `up-injected.sh:145` |
| `DEMO_NO_STORIES` | `0` | (opt-out of the above) `=1` restores the legacy structural **`small-200`** single-identity seed | `up-injected.sh:146` |
| `DEMO_STORIES_PRESET` | `stack-seeding/presets/stories.seed.yaml` | the preset the stories seed reads | `up-injected.sh:148` |
| `DEMO_NO_SETDRESS` | `0` | **set-dress is ON** — cache-first snapshot replay (taxonomy + directus + sim-embeddings) then the seed | `up-injected.sh:120` |
| `DEMO_NO_LOCAL_CONTENT` | `0` | **per-stack Directus is ON** — content is self-contained. `=1` reads content **live from prod** (the documented fallback) | `up-injected.sh:126` |
| `DEMO_NO_DIRECTUS_DRIFT_FIX` | `0` | the local-content Directus drift fix runs (only when local content is on) | `up-injected.sh:1421` |
| `DEMO_NO_CONTENT_URL_REWRITE` | `0` | the `demo_web` content-URL rewrite runs (only when local content is on) | `up-injected.sh:1458` |

### The UI tier & the presenter cockpit

| Knob | Default | Effect at default | Read at |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEMO_NO_UI` | `0` | **full UI tier is ON** — next-web + studio-desk (containers) + ant-academy (native) | `up-injected.sh:114` |
| `DEMO_NO_COCKPIT` | `0` | **presenter cockpit is SERVED** (only when `DEMO_STORIES=1`) on `7700 + N·10000`. ⚠️ **A password-free "become any seeded hero" launcher** — see [`../safety.md`](../safety.md) **§3.2** | `up-injected.sh:1483` |

### Demo-patches (platform-source fixes applied to the demo's own ephemeral clone)

See [`demopatch-spec.md`](demopatch-spec.md) for the mechanism and its 7 guards.

| Knob | Default | Effect at default | Read at |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEMO_NO_PATCH` | `0` | **all demo-patches applied** | `up-injected.sh:469` |
| `DEMO_NO_AUTHZ_SKIP` | `0` | ⚠️ **the `app-targetrole-authz-skip` patch is APPLIED** — authorization is short-circuited on the per-member target-role write path. Part of what makes a demo an **authz-weakened build** ([`../safety.md`](../safety.md) §3.2) | `up-injected.sh:792` |
| `DEMO_NO_AIREADINESS_LOADMEMBERS_BOUND` | `0` | the `app-aireadiness-snapshot-loadmembers` read-path patch is applied | `up-injected.sh:793` |
| `DEMO_NO_PERF_INDEXES` | `0` | the demo perf indexes are created | `up-injected.sh:1380` |
| `DEMO_NO_SENTINEL_RELOAD` | `0` | the sentinel casbin-policy reload runs (the silent-403 catcher) | `up-injected.sh:1350` |

### Remote access

| Knob | Default | Effect at default | Read at |
|---|---|---|---|
| `STACK_PUBLIC_HOST` | `""` → **auto-discovered** | **v2.3 M220 S3 — THE FLIP.** Empty no longer means *"localhost"*; it means *"go find out"*. On a bare `/demo-up N` the bring-up walks a **6-rung capability ladder** and, if every rung passes, adopts this box's own MagicDNS FQDN — so the demo is **remotely reachable by default**. Any failed rung ⇒ **empty ⇒ the localhost demo, byte-identical to v2.2**. Setting it explicitly (or `--public-host`) skips discovery. **A dotless host is hard-refused** — `@clerk/backend`'s `assertValidPublishableKey` rejects it | `up-injected.sh:41`, discovery at `:106` |
| `DEMO_NO_PUBLIC_HOST` | `0` | **the opt-OUT for the flip** (flag form: `--no-public-host`). `1` ⇒ do not even *probe*: no `tailscale` calls, no cert mint, forced localhost demo | `up-injected.sh:35` |
| `DEMO_NO_MKCERT` | `0` | the local-trust cert is minted (the localhost path) | `up-injected.sh:132` |

> ### ⚠️ This table is the **demo** contract. The **dev** contract is its MIRROR IMAGE.
>
> Remote reach is **default-ON for `/demo-up`** (this table) and **OPT-IN for `/dev-up`** — v2.3's
> **D-DESIGN-3**, in the user's words: *"opt-out at build time for `demo-up`, **opt-in** at build time for
> `stack up`."* The two knobs are deliberately **differently named**, and it is not cosmetic:
>
> | | knob | default | to change it |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | **demo** (`up-injected.sh`) | `STACK_PUBLIC_HOST` | `""` → **auto-discovered** | `--no-public-host` / `DEMO_NO_PUBLIC_HOST=1` |
> | **dev** (`dev-stack up`) | **`DEV_PUBLIC_HOST`** | `""` → **off; nothing is probed** | `--public-host auto` \| `<fqdn>` |
>
> **`up-injected.sh` EXPORTS `STACK_PUBLIC_HOST`** for its child launchers. Had the dev path read that same
> name, an inherited value could have flipped a dev stack world-reachable **with no flag on the command line**.
> Dev reads its own `DEV_*` knob or nothing at all. The **capability ladder is shared code** (one ladder, two
> callers — `demo-stack/tailscale_autohost.py`); only the **default** differs.

> runbook: [`tailscale-serve.md` Step 8](tailscale-serve.md) · safety: [`../safety.md` §3.5.3](../safety.md).

> ### The capability ladder — *capability-gated, never presence-probed*
>
> Auto-discovery adopts a host **only** if all six rungs pass. *"The binary exists"* is **not** *"it works"* —
> rung 6 is the whole point:
>
> 1. `tailscale` is on `PATH`
> 2. `tailscale status --json` reports `BackendState == "Running"` *(installed-but-logged-out ⇒ no)*
> 3. `.Self.DNSName` is present and **dotted** *(a dotless name is **hard-refused**, not downgraded)*
> 4. `CurrentTailnet.MagicDNSEnabled == true` *(cannot confirm ⇒ refuse)*
> 5. `tailscale serve status` shows no operator/sudo denial
> 6. **`tailscale cert` actually MINTS a certificate** *(rc=0 with no cert on disk is a **failure**)*
>
> #### 🔴 The fallback is not optional
> **Any failed rung ⇒ an EMPTY `STACK_PUBLIC_HOST` ⇒ byte-identical to a v2.2 localhost demo**, plus **one loud
> line** naming the exact fix command. Never a *partial* public path.
>
> This is a correctness requirement, not caution. `SCHEME` (`up-injected.sh:120`) and `BIND_HOST` (`:118`) both
> derive from the **same `-n $STACK_PUBLIC_HOST` predicate** — so a **half-satisfied** public path is **strictly
> worse than localhost**: every baked browser URL flips to `https://` while the listeners are still plain HTTP,
> and the demo **does not load at all**. A localhost demo always works. **A laptop with no Tailscale must stay
> byte-identical to today** — and does (fenced: `demo-stack/tests/test_public_host_flip.py`).

> 🔴 **`STACK_PUBLIC_HOST` does NOT gate network exposure — and never did.** Every demo **container** is
> published on **`0.0.0.0` (all interfaces) on every bring-up**, with or without it. What the knob adds is the
> **trusted HTTPS origin** that makes the already-reachable demo *browsable*. `BIND_HOST` — which *is* derived
> from this knob — is read only by the two **host-native** servers (cockpit, ant-academy), never a container.
> **At M220 S3 it constrained only ONE of them** (measured, M220 S3): on a localhost demo the cockpit bound
> `127.0.0.1:17700` (refused from the tailnet IP ✅) while ant-academy bound **`*:13077` and answered 200 from the
> tailnet IP** ❌ — `BIND_HOST=""` passed no `-H`, and `next dev`'s own default is `0.0.0.0`. **✅ LANDED v2.3 M221
> (F-M220-5): ant-academy now passes `-H 127.0.0.1` on the localhost path**, so it binds `127.0.0.1:13077`
> (loopback) — both host-native servers now bind loopback on a localhost demo. The **container** ports stay
> `0.0.0.0` by design (unchanged). See [`../safety.md`](../safety.md) §3.1.
> Full contract: [`../safety.md`](../safety.md) **Part 3 — the exposure side**.

### Secrets & clones

| Knob | Default | Effect at default | Read at |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEMO_NO_PROVISION` | `0` | **secrets are provisioned** into the stack's `.env` (values-blind) | `up-injected.sh:52` |
| `DEMO_SECRET_SRC` | `$REPO_ROOT/.agentspace/secrets` | where `/stack-secrets` reads the secret source from | `up-injected.sh:53` |
| `DEMO_NO_SECRET_PREFLIGHT` | `0` | the secret-coverage pre-flight runs (a CRITICAL miss is fatal) | `up-injected.sh:677` |
| `DEMO_ALLOW_UNPINNED_REXT` | `0` | the rext **tag-pin guard ABORTS** if the clone drifts from `.agentspace/rext.tag`. `=1` permits deliberate un-pinned authoring work | `ensure-clones.sh:85` |
| `DEMO_REUSE_DEV_IMAGES` | `0` | **OFF — full independence.** The demo builds from its **own** `stack-demo/` clones; dev's images are never reused | `up-injected.sh:1008` |

### Host pre-flight & verification

| Knob | Default | Effect at default | Read at |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEMO_NO_HOST_PREFLIGHT` | `0` | the host pre-flight runs (non-fatal — warns, never blocks) | `up-injected.sh:232` |
| `DEMO_VM_MIN_GIB` | `12` | Docker-VM RAM floor asserted by the pre-flight | `up-injected.sh:181` |
| `DEMO_DISK_MIN_GIB` | `20` | free-disk floor asserted by the pre-flight | `up-injected.sh:204` |
| `DEMO_NO_VERIFY` | `0` | **the bring-up auto-verify runs** on the stack's own offset ports (non-fatal). See [`../verification.md`](../verification.md) | `up-injected.sh:1594` |

## CLI flags — all 10

| Flag | Entry point | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `--public-host` | **`up-injected.sh`** | force a dotted MagicDNS FQDN for remote access, **skipping auto-discovery** (env form: `STACK_PUBLIC_HOST`) |
| `--no-public-host` | **`up-injected.sh`** | **opt OUT of the default-on remote reach** (v2.3 D-DESIGN-3): skip the capability ladder entirely — no `tailscale` probes, no cert mint — and bring up a plain localhost demo (env form: `DEMO_NO_PUBLIC_HOST=1`). Passing it **with** `--public-host` is a hard refusal, not a precedence rule |
| `--profile` | `rosetta-demo` | compose profile for a low-level `rosetta-demo up` |
| `--services` | `rosetta-demo` | bring up a **subset** of containers (no set-dress / seed / cockpit) |
| `--ref` | `rosetta-demo` | pin a git ref when cloning |
| `--only` | `rosetta-demo` | restrict an operation to named repos |
| `--resolve-only` | `rosetta-demo` | resolve refs without acting |
| `--fapi-host` | `rosetta-demo` | the fake-FAPI host for Clerkenstein injection |
| `--bapi-ip` | `rosetta-demo` | the fake-BAPI IP for Clerkenstein injection |
| `--webhook-secret` | `rosetta-demo` | the Clerkenstein webhook secret |

## The shape of the defaults, in one sentence

**A bare `/demo-up N` gives you everything**: the 3-org Stories & Heroes world, the full UI tier, the presenter
cockpit, self-contained content, every demo-patch, an auto-verify pass — and, **as of v2.3 M220 S3, remote
reachability over the tailnet** — because **every feature knob is an opt-OUT (`DEMO_NO_*`, default `0`)**.

> **v2.3 M220 S3 closed the last exception.** This section used to end: *"The only knob that is default-off is
> `STACK_PUBLIC_HOST`."* That is **no longer true** — it is now auto-discovered, and the shape has **no
> exceptions left**: every knob on this page is an opt-out. (The sentence is quoted rather than deleted because
> a summary line that outlives the behaviour it summarises is this release's signature hazard — it is how the
> *"2 orgs"* lie survived four releases.)

So *"make `/demo-up` pull all the data and seed the 3 orgs"* was **already the default**. The failures people
attribute to a missing default are almost always a **cold snapshot cache** (replay is cache-first and never
captures — see [`../snapshot-cold-start.md`](../snapshot-cold-start.md)), not a knob.
