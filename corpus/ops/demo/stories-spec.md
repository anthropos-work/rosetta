# The Verified-Skill Chain — Stories & Heroes (spec)

**The reference for the seeded *verified skill* — the spine of a believable demo world.** A demo or dev
stack's headline surfaces (a person's **skill profile** + Skill Spotlight chart, the org **Workforce
dashboard**) are driven by *verified* skills: skills a person proved by passing AI simulations. This doc is the
canonical description of how `rosetta-extensions/stack-seeding` materializes one — the **7-table chain** the
`PersonaSeeder` writes — plus the constraints that make a seeded verified skill actually *render* (and the ones
that silently hide it if you get them wrong) — **and** (v1.9 M35) the declarative **Stories & Heroes** model
that lifts it into a multi-org, thriving/struggling/manager-trio demo world.

## For PMs — what it does and why it matters

A demo only sells if the buyer sees the product's *point*: a person whose skills are **verified by the
platform**, with the gap between what they **claim** and what they've **proven** laid bare. Before M34 the
seeder built a populated-but-hollow world — users named "User 1", **zero** verified skills (the core profile
screen was empty), and session rows that were silently broken so nothing rolled up to the dashboard. M34 makes
**one hero (Maya Chen)** real, end-to-end: she has a real name and face, a profile of verified skills that
renders, a Skill Spotlight chart that plots her trajectory, and a visible **claimed-vs-verified gap** — the
single most convincing moment in the demo. It does this by writing the exact database rows the platform itself
would have produced after Maya passed a batch of simulations, **without running a single real simulation** and
**without touching production**.

## For engineers — the mechanism

### A verified skill is a 7-table fan-out, not one row

The platform produces a verified skill asynchronously: a passed `jobsimulation.session` fires a Redis-Streams
event that the `app` service's `JobsimulationSessionEndedHandler` turns into validation rows and the public
profile mirrors. The `PersonaSeeder` **short-circuits** that pipeline and writes the terminal rows directly —
per (hero × verified skill), across **three Postgres schemas**:

```
            schema: jobsimulation                         │  schema: public (app service)
 sessions (sim_type ASSESSMENT|HIRING, status='ended')  ┐ │
   └─ validation_attempt_results (evaluation_status='passed') │
        └─ validation_attempt_skill_results ◄───────────┘ │   (skill=NodeID, competency_level_score>0)
             └─ validation_criterion_results (3/session)  │
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
                                                          ├─ local_jobsimulation_sessions (the app mirror)
                                                          ├─ user_skills (is_verified=true, job_simulation_id)
                                                          └─ user_skill_evidences (UPSERT: levels+counts+verified)
 skiller.skills.node_id ── supplies the skill_id string (a loose ref, NOT a FK) ──┘
```

The seeder writes **3 passed sessions per verified skill** (the Spotlight chart hides below 2 datapoints), each
through the full chain, then one `user_skills` row per session and one UPSERTed `user_skill_evidences` per
skill. For Maya with 8 verified skills that's ~200 rows — a complete, queryable profile.

### The constraint landmines (verified against the live schema)

A raw COPY/INSERT lets you write rows the *running platform never would* — so the seeder has to honour every
constraint the app layer normally enforces. Two classes:

**DB-enforced (a violating INSERT is *rejected*):**
- `user_skills` CHECK `user_skills_check_foreign_keys` — at least one provenance edge must be non-NULL ⇒ the
  seeder sets **`job_simulation_id`** (the SIMULATION/Directus template UUID, *not* the session UUID).
- `user_skills` partial UNIQUE `idx_unique_job_simulation (skill_id, job_simulation_id, user_skill_user)` ⇒ a
  **distinct real sim template per verified row** (the seeder draws a distinct sim per session).
- `user_skill_evidences` UNIQUE `(skill_id, user_id)` ⇒ the evidence is an **UPSERT** (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT
  (skill_id, user_id) DO UPDATE`), never a blind insert — the fleet's `id`-keyed `CopyRowsIdempotent` can't
  dedup a composite UNIQUE, so this one is a per-row `Exec` (#M34-D3).
- `validation_attempt_skill_results.validation_attempt_result_id` is **NOT NULL** ⇒ the FK to its attempt
  result must be set. *(This one bit during M34 build — the seeder omitted it and the chain failed to insert;
  the integration test caught it. The unit test now asserts it.)*

**Logical (the row INSERTs fine but the UI hides or breaks it — the "inserted-but-invisible" class):**
- The session's `status` / `completion_status` / `result_status` / `sim_type` columns are **free-text
  `varchar`** (no PG enum, no CHECK). A wrong value is **filtered out of every dashboard query** at read time,
  not rejected at write. This was the **G14** bug: the pre-M34 session seeder wrote `status='completed'` (no
  such value — valid is `'ended'`), `completion_status='completed'` (valid: `passed|failed|…`),
  `result_status='passed'/'failed'` (valid: `'completed'`), and bare `'assessment'`/`'interview'`/`'training'`
  for `sim_type` (the real values are the **full `SIMULATION_TYPE_*` proto strings**, and only
  `SIMULATION_TYPE_ASSESSMENT|_HIRING` roll up to verified skills). All four are now written correctly,
  confirmed against the live value distribution.
- Levels are stored **0–100** and divided to the org scale at query (`level × maxLevel / 100`, `maxLevel`
  defaults to 5 — no settings seed needed). Store ~80 to read as 4/5. *(Two distinct scales: the
  `user_skill_evidences.*_level` columns + validation scores are 0–100; `user_skills.level` is a separate
  ~1–5 convention with no DB bound. Don't conflate.)*
- The misspelled column **`local_jobsimulation_sessions.completition_status`** (sic) — copy it exactly.
- The session `token` is a free-text varchar but the app-layer validator bounds it to `^[a-z0-9]{5,10}$` ⇒ the
  seeder writes a 7-char hex token, not a 36-char UUID.

### The claimed-vs-verified gap — set `user_level` (the reference omission)

The demo's headline widget diffs **`user_skill_evidences.user_level`** (what the person *claims*) against
**`anthropos_level`** (what the simulations *verified*). The reference `seed.sql` the chain was ported from
sets `level` and `anthropos_level` but **never `user_level`** — porting it verbatim leaves `user_level` NULL,
and the widget **excludes every row**. The `PersonaSeeder` therefore sets `user_level` explicitly per the
hero's **`self_eval_bias`**: `under` (a modest under-claimer — `user_level < anthropos_level`, the thriving
arc), `over` (an inflated over-claimer — the stark gap, the struggling arc), or `calibrated` (≈ equal). At
least one skill per hero must show a real gap or the widget is empty.

### Closure — real skill node-ids, never fabricated, and *measured*

A skill ref (`user_skills.skill_id`, `user_skill_evidences.skill_id`,
`validation_attempt_skill_results.skill`) is a loose string (`K-XXXXXX-XXXX`), **not a DB FK**. A fabricated
node-id passes every field-regex but **dangles** — it resolves to no skill in `skiller`, so the profile
federates a blank name/category and the chart has a hole (the skill-side analog of the M23 empty-picker class).
Two pieces guarantee closure:

- **The `TaxonomyRefs` resolver** draws every skill node-id from the **real replayed public `skiller`
  taxonomy** — role-coherent where the hero's role resolves (`skillsByRole`: `job_roles ⋈ job_role_skills ⋈
  skills`, public-only, is_core-first), falling back to a flat public-skill pool otherwise. If **no** taxonomy
  has been replayed (an empty pool), the seeder **skips** the hero — it **never fabricates** a node-id.
- **The seed-side closure gene** (`datadna measure-closure --stack demo-N`) then *proves* it: it counts the
  distinct seeded skill node-ids (across all three ref surfaces) that don't resolve in the replayed
  `skiller.skills` — must be **0**, naming a sample on failure. This mirrors the M23
  `snapshot-cross-surface-closure` gene (the content side); together they are the closure family (see
  [`../../architecture/`](../../architecture/) and the `dna/README.md` in the extension). "Believable" is
  **measured, not assumed.**

### The supporting fixes (population believability)

- **`jobsim_sessions.go` (G14)** — beyond the valid enums, the session score is now a **continuous, mid-skewed
  0–100 distribution with a per-user upward growth arc** (replacing the binary 85/35), and `sim_type` is
  weighted ~75% toward the verification-feeding ASSESSMENT/HIRING types. The arc gives the dashboard's
  Growth/Biggest-Improvers a real trend to narrate (the "company mid AI-transformation" story).
- **`users.go`** — real first/last names from an in-code name bank, a deterministic **real-face avatar**
  (v1.10 M39 — see below), and a `first.last@<org-domain>` email (no more "User N" / no picture /
  `@{stack}.local`). A blueprint **hero**'s real name + email land at the population index the `PersonaSeeder`
  verifies her chain against, so the named row and the verified skills are one user — both seeders derive that
  index from the same shared bridge (`personaUserIndex` / `personaIndexMap`), so they cannot drift (#M34-D2).
  v1.10 M39 also has `users.go` **backfill `public.user_basic_info`** (the /profile header source) — see the
  profile-identity layer below.

### The profile-identity layer (v1.10 "method acting" M39)

v1.9 seeded the verified-skill **spine**, but a logged-in hero's **profile page** still read thin: the top bar
showed a generic org, the header showed "no role", and the avatar was a 2-letter initials disc. M39 lights the
three highest-leverage, lowest-effort identity fixes — **tooling + docs only, zero platform-repo edits** — so a
hero (Maya on demo-3) shows the **right company, a real role+title, and a real face**.

- **Org name (G1) — the roster carries the story org.** The FAPI org resource used to hardcode "Clerkenstein
  Demo Org". Now `roster.go` threads each hero's `st.Org.Name`/slug into the roster JSON (`org_name`/`org_slug`),
  Clerkenstein renders it on the org resource, and the **top bar reads the real company** (e.g. "Cervato
  Systems"). It's a `DisallowUnknownFields` **paired change** across the two structs + a no-roster
  `"Clerkenstein Demo Org"` fallback — the full mechanism is in
  [`../../services/clerkenstein.md` § Roster org-name threading](../../services/clerkenstein.md#multi-identity).

- **Role backfill (G2) — `user_basic_info`, the table the header actually reads.** The /profile header reads
  `profile.info.jobRole` → `infoResolver.JobRole` ← **`public.user_basic_info.job_role_id`** — but the seeder
  wrote the role only to `public.memberships` (the wrong table for the header), so the header showed "no role".
  M39 has `users.go` **backfill `user_basic_info`** (`job_role_id` + `job_title` + a deterministic believable
  `summary` + `location`) from the **same resolved role** it writes to the membership. The trigger-created row
  already exists, so it's an **idempotent UPDATE keyed by `id`** with an `IS DISTINCT FROM` guard (a re-seed of
  identical data matches 0 rows — the M17 re-run contract — #M39-D4/D5). **One UPDATE lights two surfaces**: the header
  role/title **and** the role-gap radar / role-readiness widgets (`jobRoleMatch` keys off the same field). The
  no-fabrication rule holds: `job_role_id` is NULL with no replayed taxonomy, and a hero keeps her **declared**
  role label as the title (the same split `users.go` applies to `memberships.job_role_name`). Backfilled for
  **every** member (not heroes only) so any profile a presenter clicks into reads coherent. Real schema (no
  `job_role_title` column — the header uses `job_role_id` → resolved label + `job_title`; `email` is NOT NULL
  UNIQUE, which is why it must be an UPDATE not an INSERT).

- **Real-face avatars (G4) — offline, deterministic, license-clean.** `users.picture` was a DiceBear
  *initials* SVG fetched from `api.dicebear.com` — a 2-letter disc **and** an online fetch a sealed demo box
  can't reach. M39's `avatar.go` is a self-authored **parametric SVG face generator**: it draws an illustrated
  human face (varied skin tone, hair colour/style, eyes, brows, nose, mouth) chosen deterministically by
  hashing the user's uuid over bounded palettes, and emits it as a **`data:image/svg+xml;base64,…` URI** written
  straight into `users.picture`. That makes it **offline-safe** (zero network fetch), **deterministic** (same
  user → same face, reruns byte-identical), **license-clean** (the SVG is authored in-repo — no third-party
  asset, nothing to vendor), and tiny (~1 KB, fits the unbounded `varchar`). It IS a face, not an initials disc
  (#M39-D7).

The live acceptance: re-seed demo-3 + log in as Maya → the top bar shows "Cervato Systems", the profile shows a
role + title + summary + location, and every person carries a real face. Code-of-record: `rosetta-extensions`
@ tag `method-acting-m39`. Out of M39 scope (later milestones): work/education history + skill depth (M41); the
library + activity-feed serve-grant (M40).

### The profile-depth layer (v1.10 "method acting" M41)

M39 gave the logged-in hero the right **identity** (company, role+title, face); M41 gives her the **depth** behind
it: a believable **work history + education timeline** and a **deep, role-aligned skill set with a wide, obvious
claimed-vs-verified gap**. Before M41 the `/profile` timeline was empty (`public.user_experiences` /
`public.user_educations` were **0 rows DB-wide** — written by no seeder) and the skill set was shallow (preset
`verified: 8` → 8 distinct verified skills). M41 adds a new **`ProfileSeeder`** (surface `"profiles"`) and bumps
the depth — **tooling + docs only, zero platform-repo edits**; the `/profile` timeline reads
`ent.UserExperience` / `ent.UserEducation` via `TimelineGrouped(userID)` unchanged — M41 only supplies the rows.

- **Work history + education (G3).** Per **end-user** hero (a manager has no personal timeline — skipped), the
  `ProfileSeeder` writes a believable **3-job role progression** (`user_experiences`) + a **degree**
  (`user_educations`), all deterministic + backdated within/just-before the story's activity span so the history
  corroborates the verified skills. The titles reuse the **resolved `jobRoleRefs`** (the same role node-id the
  membership carries), the per-entry `skills` json is a role-coherent slice of **real public skill names** (from
  `resolveNamedSkillRefs`), and the current role is open-ended (`to` NULL). **Live-schema landmines** (the
  overview's column guesses were wrong — these are verified against demo-3): `user_experiences.company` is
  `uuid NOT NULL` with an FK → `companies(id)` (the GraphQL `Company` resolver does `QueryCompany().Only(ctx)`,
  so a NULL/dangling company errors the whole timeline) ⇒ the seeder writes a real **`companies`** row per
  distinct employer; `from`/`to` are **DATE** (not timestamptz) with a `from<=to OR to IS NULL` CHECK;
  `location_type` is the **lowercase** ent enum `inoffice|hybrid|fullremote` (a wrong-case value inserts but the
  GraphQL `LocationType` enum can't map it); and the `skills` column is **`json`** — an array of skill names.

- **Skill depth + the claimed-but-unverified tail (G5).** The preset `verified:` knob is bumped **8 → ~30** for
  the thriving heroes (`stories.seed.yaml` + `stories-maya.seed.yaml`), so the verified chain writes **~30
  distinct verified skills × `verifiedSessionsPerSkill` (3) ⇒ ~90 `user_skills` + ~30 evidences** on the
  verified side. **On top**, the `ProfileSeeder` seeds a **~60-skill claimed-but-unverified tail**:
  `user_skills` with `is_verified=false`, **no `job_simulation_id`**, and `user_skill_evidences` with
  **`anthropos_level` NULL, `user_level` set** — so the profile "overall" reads **≈ 90 = ~30 verified + ~60
  claimed**, **widening** the visible claimed-vs-verified gap (the demo's headline aha). The **DB landmine**:
  `user_skills_check_foreign_keys` requires ≥1 provenance edge non-NULL — since the tail has no
  `job_simulation_id`, it ties to the seeded **work history** via `user_skill_experience` /
  `user_skill_education` (which *also* makes the claimed skills render **under** each work experience — the
  `workExperience.Skills` resolver reads `userskill.HasExperienceWith`). The tail draws skills **distinct** from
  the verified set (it offsets past the first `EffectiveVerified()` of the same role-coherent-then-flat combined
  pool), so the two counts don't overlap. Both arcs read coherent: a thriving **under-claimer**'s deep profile
  and a struggling **over-claimer**'s stark gap (few verified, many claimed) are each believable.

The **gap mechanic is intact** — `user_level` (claimed) vs `anthropos_level` (verified) is still the widget's
spine; the unverified tail leaves `anthropos_level` NULL so the gap renders, and the verified evidence UPSERT is
never clobbered (the claimed UPSERT's `ON CONFLICT … WHERE is_verified = false` guard keeps the verified side
winning). **Closure stays measured** — every skill node-id/name comes from the same replayed taxonomy resolvers
the verified chain uses; no replayed taxonomy → the timeline still writes (blank skills/role — never fabricated)
and the tail is skipped, so the closure gene stays green. Every table the seeder writes (`companies`,
`user_experiences`, `user_educations`, `user_skills`, `user_skill_evidences`) is **`PerStackIsolated`**.

The live acceptance: re-seed demo-3 + log in as Maya → the `/profile` Work Experience + Education sections
populate with a believable career, and her skill set reads deep (~30 verified + ~60 claimed) with a wide,
obvious claimed-vs-verified gap. Code-of-record: `rosetta-extensions` @ tag `method-acting-m41`. Out of M41
scope (later milestones): the employee/manager 100%-coverage Playwright sweeps (M42e/M42m).

## The blueprint — declaring a hero

A hero is a `personas` entry in the stack blueprint (`stack.seed.yaml`). The M34 vertical-slice shape:

```yaml
personas:
  - id: maya-thriving       # stable key (seeds her deterministic user index)
    name: Maya Chen
    role: Backend Developer  # a public job_role with role-skills → role-coherent verified skills
    verified: 8              # number of distinct skills to verify (the chain runs once per skill)
    self_eval_bias: under    # under | over | calibrated — drives the claimed-vs-verified gap
```

The shipped `presets/stories-maya.seed.yaml` is the runnable vertical-slice world (Cervato Systems + Maya).
The `personas` list is **optional** and **additive** — heroes ride on top of the generic population, so a
blueprint without personas seeds exactly as before. The full multi-org model is below.

## The Stories & Heroes model (M35)

M35 graduates the single-hero `personas` shape into a declarative **`stories[]`** model: **one
`stack.stories.yaml` seeds multiple orgs**, each with a **thriving / struggling / manager hero trio** at
vantage-appropriate fidelity. It **supersedes** the org-centric single-org blueprint for a believable demo
world; the size-tier presets (`dev-min`, `small-200`, …) stay for light structural dev seeds.

### The shape

```yaml
stack: demo-1
stories:
  - id: ai-transformation               # seeds this story's deterministic OrgID
    name: "AI Transformation & Reskilling"
    org: { name: Cervato Systems, slug: cervato-systems, industry: software, narrative: ai-transformation, size: 220, activity: { months: 6, pass_rate: 0.7 } }
    heroes:
      - id: maya-thriving
        name: Maya Chen
        role: Backend Developer          # a public job_role WITH role-skills (role-coherent — see O6)
        vantage: end-user                # the SEAT: end-user (individual surfaces) | manager (org dashboard)
        trajectory: thriving             # the ARC: thriving | struggling (end-users only)
        skills: { verified: 8, mapped: 22, category_breadth: 4, self_eval_bias: under, arc: rising }
      - { id: tom-struggling, name: Tom Becker, role: Backend Developer, vantage: end-user, trajectory: struggling, skills: { verified: 2, self_eval_bias: over, arc: flat } }
      - { id: dan-manager,    name: Dan Rossi,  role: Engineering Manager, vantage: manager }   # rides the aggregates
  - id: sales-ramp
    org: { name: Solvantis, slug: solvantis, industry: saas-sales, narrative: onboarding-ramp, size: 120 }
    heroes: [ … Sara·thriving / Nick·struggling / Leah·manager … ]
```

The shipped `presets/stories.seed.yaml` is the runnable locked **2-stories × 3-heroes** roster.

### Vantage & trajectory (the two hero axes)

- **`vantage`** (`end-user | manager`) — the **seat** into the product. An end-user hero demos the *individual*
  surfaces (profile, Spotlight, my-growth); a manager hero demos the *org-intelligence* surfaces (Workforce
  dashboard, team gaps, succession). **A manager seeds NO verified-skill chain of her own** — she reads the org
  aggregates her employee heroes populate (the coherence property: the two employees ARE her standout high/low
  rows). `""` defaults to end-user.
- **`trajectory`** (`thriving | struggling`) — the **arc** of an end-user. It drives the verified-skill
  fidelity AND (when `self_eval_bias` is unset) the claimed-vs-verified bias:
  - **thriving** → dense (more verified skills) · high level band (~L4) · rising growth arc · **under-claims**.
  - **struggling** → sparse (few) · low band (~L1–L2) · flat arc · **over-claims** (the stark gap the demo
    turns on).

Each hero's `skills:` block (`verified` / `mapped` / `category_breadth` / `self_eval_bias` / `arc`) **overrides**
the trajectory-derived defaults when present; absent, the trajectory drives everything.

### Multi-org — per-story `OrgID`, the platform's real multi-tenancy

Each story is **one org**. The seeder derives a **deterministic per-story `OrgID`** and threads it through
**every** seeder (`org` / `users` / `identity` / `jobsim-sessions` / `skillpath-sessions` / `assignments` /
`activity` / `personas`), so all orgs live in one stack's per-stack Postgres scoped by `organization_id` —
mirroring the platform's real multi-tenancy (so it's *more* realistic, not a hack). Two key rules:

- **The FIRST story keeps the Clerkenstein default org** (`22222222-…` = `DefaultDemoUser().OrgEid`, clerk id
  `org_clerkenstein`) so a **single-identity demo login** (the only mode until M37) lands in it. Every later
  story gets its own deterministic id. The demo identity (`IdentitySeeder`) is seeded **only** for the first
  story — the per-story selectable identity registry is M37.
- **Per-story id namespacing.** Two stories' populations never collide: the first story uses the bare stack
  key, later stories prefix with `:story:<id>`. (Keeping the first story bare is what preserves the M34
  single-org ids byte-for-byte — the legacy single-org path is unchanged.)

### Hero placement — collision-free declaration-order slots

A hero rides on a population user row (D2): the `UsersSeeder` writes her real name at the slot the
`PersonaSeeder` verifies against. M35 assigns heroes the **first `len(heroes)` population slots in declaration
order** (collision-free by construction; the blueprint's `len(heroes) <= size` validation guarantees they fit).
*(M34 hashed heroes into the population, which collided ~10% of the time for a trio in a 30-person org — sharing
a manager's row with an employee's name. The declaration-order fix makes the trio's rows correct, not just
visible; a non-fatal warning still fires for the residual Size<heroes clamp case.)*

### Supporting-population fidelity

Every member (not just heroes) gets a **real replayed job role** — `memberships.job_role_id` is set to a real
public `job_roles.node_id` (the `J-XXXXXX-XXXX` form, NOT a uuid) drawn at run time from the **replayed** stack's
roles that *have* role-skills (`jobroleref.go`, mirroring the skill-side `TaxonomyRefs`; no taxonomy replayed →
left NULL, never fabricated) — plus a **ramped `joined_at`** (`memberships.created_at` spread across the activity
span, so the org reads as one that grew over time). The trio sits in a believable org.

### Closure across all orgs

The seed-side closure gene is **org-agnostic** (it counts every dangling seeded skill ref vs the replayed
taxonomy, with no org filter), so `datadna measure-closure` proves **0 dangling refs across all orgs** — the
multi-org world is as closed as the single-org one. As of M36 the gene spans **four** seeded skill-ref surfaces
(it now also covers `public.membership_skills.skill_id`, the dashboard mapped surface — see below).

## The Workforce dashboard surfaces (M36)

M34/M35 made the **individual** profile believable (Must #1). M36 makes the **org Workforce-Intelligence
dashboard** (REST `/api/workforce/*`, the org-admin view) believable for the seeded story (Must #2): every
aggregate renders **non-empty and distributed**, not binary-or-zero. A manager hero (e.g. Dan Rossi) logs in and
sees her two employee heroes as the standout high/low rows of an org that reads real around them. Six new
seeders + two fixes land the **spine** (not every widget — the hard scope line):

| Surface | Seeder (`stack-seeding/seeders/`) | What it feeds on the dashboard |
|---|---|---|
| **Mapped skills** | `membership_skills.go` | The mapped→verified **verification funnel**. Every member is mapped to a role-coherent set of real public skills (the `skill_name` is set — every dashboard query filters it NOT NULL); since mapped covers ~all members but only a subset verify, **mapped outnumbers verified per skill** → the believable drop-off. The funnel joins the mapped side to the verified side **on the skill _name_, not the node-id** — so `membership_skills.skill_name` must equal the verified skills' `skiller.skills.name`; the seeder's `skillref_named.go` resolver draws names from the same replayed taxonomy the verified chain uses, so they line up by construction (#M36-D1). Also feeds the **AI-readiness** scan (an AI-narrative org biases a share of members toward AI-named skills). |
| **Teams / tags** | `tags.go` | The universal **slice dimension**: a dozen business-unit tags (front-loaded so the Teams tab is non-uniform) + a cross-cutting **`mentor`** tag (the Growth-tab Mentors KPI counts members tagged `mentor`). Each member is on exactly one business unit. |
| **Target roles** | `target_roles.go` | The **gap + two-way internal mobility**: `organization_target_roles` (an admin-set development target = the gap) + `user_target_roles` (a self-set aspiration = mobility-ready), each a real public role node-id chosen different from the member's current role. |
| **Succession feeders** | `succession.go` | `interview_extraction_results` for >20% of members (with the `summary` jsonb the succession query reads) to lift the **Succession tab** past the coverage gate (`too_sparse` → `full`). Trajectory-aware: a struggling hero reads at-risk (low wellbeing + negative sentiment), a thriving one reads positive. (The other feeder, `validation_attempt_*`, already lands via the M34 chain.) |
| **Feedback** | `feedback.go` | `job_simulation_feedbacks` at **~2:1 positive** (the Italgas anchor), `is_positive` matched to the option's polarity — the "people liked it" signal. |
| **Org-scale gap** | `population_evidence.go` | The **claimed-vs-verified gap at org scale** (the headline "aha", §3c): a ~55% share of the *supporting* population (not just heroes) gets verified-skill evidence rows with both `user_level` (claim) and `anthropos_level` (verified) set and **diverging** — a population mix of over- and under-claimers. (`user_skill_evidences` has no FK on `jobsimulation_session_id`, so a population evidence row is a clean write without the full hero chain; the heroes' full 7-table chain is the PersonaSeeder's.) |

Two **fixes** (not new seeders) round out the spine:

- **Assignments status mix** (`assignments.go`) — the pre-M36 seeder wrote every assignment as bare
  `active` / no `due_date` / no session, so the dashboard bucketed **all** of them as `not_started`. M36 gives
  each a deterministic lifecycle bucket (~35% completed / ~15% overdue / ~35% in-progress / ~15% not-started)
  realized via `status` + a past/future `due_date` + (for completed/in-progress) an
  `organization_assignment_sessions` row carrying progress. That session FKs a `local_skill_path_sessions` row
  the seeder also writes — the dashboard reads the **app mirror** `local_skill_path_sessions`, NOT
  `skillpath.skill_path_sessions` (#M36-D2), and the population has no `local_jobsimulation_sessions` mirror, so
  the session takes the skill-path arm of the table's check constraint (#M36-D3).
- **Skillpath completed share** (`skillpath_sessions.go`) — the learning-session seeder marked `completed`
  only on an exact `progress=100` (~1%), starving the learning/my-growth surfaces. M36 makes ~30% complete.

**Distribution coherence.** The growth arc (Growth/Biggest-Improvers) and the over/under-claimer split are
*correlated with the heroes*: the thriving employee is the dashboard's top-performer / succession candidate; the
struggling employee is the at-risk / needs-attention row — the **same** coherence property M35 established,
surfaced now at org scale.

**Closure stays measured.** Every new skill-ref surface draws its node-ids from the **same** taxonomy resolver
the chain uses, so the seed-side closure gene (extended to `membership_skills`) still proves **0 dangling refs**
— the mapped funnel is as closed as the verified chain.

## The presenter cockpit (M38)

The seeded world (M34–M36) + the Clerkenstein multi-identity seat-switch (M37) make the *individual* surfaces
real; **M38** makes the whole Stories & Heroes engine **clickable**. The **presenter cockpit** is a standalone
served panel that lists each story → its hero trio and, per hero, two actions — **[Login as]** and **[Jump to
section]** — so a demo-giver picks a hero, lands logged-in as her on the right screen, and presents that part of
the story live.

### For PMs — the demo-driving surface

A demo flows: *show Maya's verified-skill profile → show Tom's stark claimed-vs-verified gap → log in as their
manager Dan and watch the same two people become the standout high/low rows of his Workforce dashboard.* The
cockpit is the remote control for that flow: one click logs in as the chosen hero and jumps to her screen. No
typing a login, no hunting for the right URL — the story is a menu.

### The shape

```
Presenter Cockpit — demo-3
  Story: AI Transformation & Reskilling   (Cervato Systems · 220 people)
    ▸ Maya Chen — Backend Developer · EMPLOYEE · THRIVING
        "8 verified skills, rising growth arc, mobility-ready"        [Login as] [▶ Profile]
    ▸ Tom Becker — Backend Developer · EMPLOYEE · STRUGGLING
        "Few/low verified skills, OVER-rates himself (stark gap)"     [Login as] [▶ Profile]
    ▸ Dan Rossi — Engineering Manager · MANAGER
        "Team gaps, role-readiness, succession (Maya), at-risk (Tom)" [Login as] [▶ Workforce · Skills Verification]
  Story: SDR Onboarding & Ramp   (Solvantis · 120 people)
    ▸ Sara Whitfield · EMPLOYEE·THRIVING  /  Nick Alvarez · EMPLOYEE·STRUGGLING  /  Leah Donovan · MANAGER
```

(Display-label note: `vantage: end-user` renders as **EMPLOYEE**, `manager` as **MANAGER** — the YAML attribute
value stays `end-user | manager`; "employee" is a label, not an enum value.)

### For engineers — how it works

**Standalone served panel, never an in-app overlay (D15).** The cockpit is a host-native HTTP server
(`rosetta-extensions/demo-stack/cockpit.py`, stdlib only) on an **offset port** (`7700 + N·10000`), brought up
with the stack and torn down with it — it is **never** an edit to next-web. This preserves the hard
zero-platform-repo-edit line: the cockpit reaches the platform only as a browser would (over the FAPI
handshake), never by modifying it.

**Single source — it reads the same `stack.stories.yaml` that seeded the data (D9).** The cockpit menu is a
**manifest** the seeder projects from the very file that seeded the heroes (`stackseed --cockpit-export`), so
the annotations describing a hero in the cockpit are the same ones that scoped her seed — the menu can never
drift from the data. (The demo tooling is stdlib-only Python, so the YAML is parsed once on the Go side and the
panel reads the derived JSON — single-source preserved.)

**[Login as] + [Jump to section] = one FAPI handshake redirect.** Both actions point the browser at the
multi-identity fake FAPI's handshake with the hero's seat-switch key:

```
https://<fapi-host>/v1/client/handshake?__clerk_identity=<hero-key>&redirect_url=<jump_to>
```

`<fapi-host>` is the per-stack fake-FAPI on its own **offset port** `127.0.0.1:<5400 + N·10000>` (e.g.
`127.0.0.1:35400` for `demo-3`), served over HTTPS (clerk-js requires it); `redirect_url` is an absolute
next-web URL on the app's offset port `<3000 + N·10000>`. The FAPI selects the chosen hero's seat from
`__clerk_identity` **then** establishes the session and redirects to `redirect_url` — so the hero is the
active identity *everywhere* (the client view, `/v1/me`, the minted token, the cookies) AND the browser lands
on her screen, in one move. **[Login as]** lands on the app root; **[Jump to section]** lands on the hero's
`jump_to` deep-link. The key is the hero's `stories.yaml` id — the **same** key the roster export gave
Clerkenstein's registry, so the seat always resolves. (The handshake + multi-identity selection are M37; see
[`clerkenstein/knowledge/architecture.md` § Multi-identity].)

**The roster-export producer — the M37 integration seam.** M37 shipped the *consumer* (the fake FAPI loads a
`[]DemoUser` roster from `FAKE_FAPI_ROSTER`); M38 ships the *producer*. `stackseed --roster-export` derives the
roster JSON — each hero's **exact** clerk claims (`auth_id`/`eid`/`email`/`org_*`/`org_role`) — **single-sourced
from the seeder's own id-derivation** (so "login as Maya" authenticates the real seeded user). Clerkenstein is a
separate Go module and never imports the seeder; the seeder/demo-tooling exports, Clerkenstein consumes. The
demo bring-up sets `FAKE_FAPI_ROSTER` on the `demo-N-fake-fapi` container so its FAPI is multi-identity. The
`org_role` claim is **vantage-faithful** — a hero's exported role follows her seat (manager → `admin`,
end-user → `member`), single-sourced through one `roleForHero` helper that the seeder also writes the
`membership` row + the casbin `g2` grant with, so the three writes agree per hero (an "employee" demo seat
reads as `member` in her JWT, not org-admin) (#M38-D8).

**The deep-link catalog (O9).** The cockpit ships an enumerated, stable set of next-web routes per vantage — the
*individual* surfaces an end-user hero demos (`/profile`, Skill Spotlight, my-growth, take-a-sim) and the
*org-intelligence* surfaces a manager hero demos (the Workforce dashboard tabs — verification / role-readiness /
succession / mobility — plus the talent pool). A hero's `jump_to` is matched against this catalog for its button
label; an unrecognized `jump_to` still works (it's a raw path) with a generic label.

### Bring it up

```bash
# A storytelling demo: DEMO_STORIES=1 seeds the 2-org hero trio, wires the multi-identity fake-fapi, and
# serves the cockpit. Default-off keeps every existing demo byte-identical (structural seed, single-identity).
DEMO_STORIES=1 /demo-up 3
# → the cockpit serves on http://localhost:37700 (7700 + 3·10000). Pick a hero → [Login as] → [Jump].
```

`DEMO_NO_COCKPIT=1` brings up the stories demo without the panel (e.g. an API-only run); `DEMO_STORIES_PRESET`
overrides the preset (default `presets/stories.seed.yaml`). The cockpit + roster + seed all pin `--stack demo-N`,
so the exported ids and the seeded rows are guaranteed to match.

## Running it

```bash
# 1. Replay the public reference library FIRST (a --local-content demo does this automatically, cache-first):
stacksnap replay --surface taxonomy --stack demo-N   # the skill node-ids the chain draws from
stacksnap replay --surface directus --stack demo-N   # the sim templates the sessions link to

# 2. Seed the world. The M34 vertical slice (one hero):
stackseed --stack demo-N --seed presets/stories-maya.seed.yaml
#    …or the M35 full multi-org roster (2 orgs × the thriving/struggling/manager trio):
stackseed --stack demo-N --seed presets/stories.seed.yaml

# 3. Prove closure (every seeded skill ref resolves in the replayed taxonomy — all orgs):
datadna measure-closure --stack demo-N               # exit 1 on any dangling ref
```

Without a taxonomy replay the `PersonaSeeder` skips the hero (no fabrication) and her profile is empty — the
taxonomy snapshot is an explicit prerequisite for the verified-skill chain, surfaced by an empty pool, not a
silent failure. A `--local-content` demo stack replays both by default, so a bare `/demo-up N` already lands a
seeded, set-dressed world.

## Safety

Every table the chain writes — `jobsimulation.sessions`, `validation_attempt_*`,
`validation_criterion_results`, `public.local_jobsimulation_sessions`, `public.user_skills`,
`public.user_skill_evidences` — is **`PerStackIsolated`** (the stack's own offset-port Postgres container), so
the chain inherits the existing zero-pollution posture: it cannot touch production or another stack, and the
seeding run's audit log proves it. See [`../safety.md`](../safety.md) §2.1. The taxonomy it reads is the
**public** reference data the snapshot firewall already guaranteed public-only at capture.
