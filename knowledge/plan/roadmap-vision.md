# Roadmap — Vision

Future versions and proposals, not yet in active development. The active version lives in
[`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md). When a version starts development, its section moves from here into `roadmap.md`
and a `release/{version}` branch is cut.

> **Promotion history:** **v1.0 "body double"** → 2026-06-02 (shipped 2026-06-03, tag `v1.0`).
> **v1.1 "show floor"** → 2026-06-03 (shipped 2026-06-05, tag `v1.1`).
> **v1.2 "set dressing"** → 2026-06-05 (shipped 2026-06-07, tag `v1.2`).
> **v1.3 "stack party"** → 2026-06-07 (shipped 2026-06-07, tag `v1.3`; the **dev/demo convergence** — dev stacks as
> first-class peers, a unified first-available-N stack registry, generic `stack-*` skills, a code-cited safety doc).
> **v1.3b "dress rehearsal"** → 2026-06-08 (shipped 2026-06-09, tag `v1.3.1`; the **field-hardening release** for
> the 14 issues the first real `/demo-up` run surfaced — `/demo-up` now produces a full/populated/verified/demoable
> stack, M16→M20; tooling + docs only, zero platform-repo edits).
> **v1.5 "prop room"** → 2026-06-11 (shipped 2026-06-14, tag `v1.5`; the **local-Directus release** — a real per-stack
> Directus serving the captured public content, demo-default + dev-opt-in, M21→M25). The first version staged after the
> v1.4 removal.
> **v1.6 "stage door"** → 2026-06-14 (shipped 2026-06-14, tag `v1.6`; the **secret-provisioning release** — one
> mechanism that ingests a secret source [dir/zip, default `.agentspace/secrets`] and provisions every repo of a stack,
> with a secret-coverage DNA that lists + keeps-listed the required secrets per repo, M27→M30). Requested directly by
> the user, not from prior backlog.
> **v1.7 "house lights"** → 2026-06-15 (shipped 2026-06-15, tag `v1.7`; the **demo-UI-hardening release** — a fresh
> browser at a demo's offset UI renders with zero manual steps: M31 a locally-trusted **mkcert** FAPI cert [so next-web
> stops blanking] + M32 the studio-desk single-port/production fix, M31→M32; tooling + docs only, zero platform-repo
> edits). Triggered by a live next-web blank-page defect, not from prior backlog.
> **v1.8 "understudy"** → 2026-06-15 (shipped 2026-06-15, tag `v1.8`; the **self-contained-demo
> release** — give `stack-demo/` its own platform clone set so a box with only `stack-demo/` runs a demo end-to-end:
> a single `section` milestone **M26** that re-implements the orphaned `m26/self-contained-demo` branch onto current
> `main`, preserving v1.6/v1.7; tooling + docs only, zero platform-repo edits). **Graduated from the unscheduled
> backlog** (the orphaned ext effort) on the user's "fill just that gap" go-ahead.
> **v1.9 "storytelling"** → 2026-06-22 (IN DEVELOPMENT; the **believable-demo-narrative release** — convert the
> placeholder seeder into a declarative **Stories & Heroes** engine: per-story org + a thriving/struggling/manager
> hero trio seeded via the real **verified-skill chain**, so the **skill profile** + the **Workforce dashboard**
> tell a story, plus a **presenter cockpit**; 5 `section` milestones M34→M38; tooling + docs only). Designed from
> the adversarially-verified spec [`.agentspace/seeding_gaps.md`](../../.agentspace/seeding_gaps.md). The first
> version since v1.5 to come from a substantive backlog/spec rather than a live defect.

> **In development.** v1.9 "storytelling" was designed + promoted 2026-06-22 (branch `release/01.90-storytelling`;
> full detail in the `## In Development — v1.9` section of [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md)). No further version is staged
> behind it — the next awaits a `/developer-kit:design-roadmap` run after v1.9 closes.

## Unscheduled backlog (not a planned release)

Genuinely-deferred work, no target version, not scheduled:

- **M33 — ant-academy demo liveness** (deferred from v1.7 design, 2026-06-15, repro-first). The ant-academy demo
  surface runs **native** (nohup + pidfile + a kill-0 relaunch guard in `ant-academy.sh`), not a container — so on a
  later visit `:33077+offset` can be dead. Root cause is **unconfirmed** (most likely the launching `/demo-up` session
  reaping the nohup'd process tree on session-end, NOT a tooling bug — re-running `/demo-up` relaunches it). **Scope
  only after reproducing the exact "dead on later visit" scenario**; likely doc-only (document the "native — re-run
  `/demo-up` to relaunch" reality in `frontend-tier.md`) or a minimal liveness loop if repro proves a real gap. Smaller
  payoff (academy is the least-central, Vercel-native, Clerk-only demo surface) — deliberately left out of v1.7's firm scope.
- **DEF-M10-01 — cloud `SnapshotStore` backend + S3 media blob bytes.** Today the cache is the local
  `.agentspace/snapshots/` store and media replays **refs-only**. **Re-signed → backlog at v1.5 design (2026-06-11)**
  after its v1.4 destination was removed; its **user-facing sting is gone** — v1.5 "prop room" keeps the asset plane
  on prod public links so demos show **real images** without the blob-byte work. Real blob mirroring + the cloud
  store stay gated on **eu-west-1 S3 read access actually landing** (verified not wired). Replay-only to a per-stack
  isolated bucket, never the shared prod S3.
- **DEF-M21-01 — `replayCmd` conn-seam hermetic test.** A hermetic `replayCmd`-wiring test needs an injectable
  connector seam (>50 lines, touches the load-bearing replay path). Tracked KEEP across the M21→M25 close-audits;
  **landed here at v1.5 close-release (2026-06-14)** so it survives the release-branch merge. Pick up in a future
  `stack-snapshot` build iter when the replay path is next opened.
- **M25-D9 — dev-`N` taxonomy replay `rc=4` ("target schema empty").** A pre-existing dev-stack migrate-ordering
  nuance on opt-in `dev-N≥1 --local-content` stacks (non-fatal, orthogonal to the content-serve path — the directus
  content-serve done-bar DB-2 is GREEN). Surfaced by the M25 field-bake; tracked dev migrate-ordering follow-up.

**Dropped from tracking (2026-06-11, user instruction — re-proposal requires a fresh `/developer-kit:design-roadmap` run):**
the former v1.4 seeds **AI-generated content**, **external stack shareability** (Tailscale/ingress), and **more
mirror engines**; the **deployment/injection CI gate** (a local-only alignment surface; gates nothing in the
demo/dev workflow); and the **`/dev-up` frontend-image pre-warm** question (a UX nicety with no owner).

## Codename notes
- _(v1.0 "body double" + v1.1 "show floor" + v1.2 "set dressing" + v1.3 "stack party" + v1.3b "dress rehearsal" + v1.5 "prop room" + v1.6 "stage door" + v1.7 "house lights" + v1.8 "understudy" shipped — their codenames are now permanent. **v1.8 "understudy"** continued the theatre lineage: an understudy is a fully self-contained substitute, ready to perform on its own without the lead — exactly the self-contained-demo thesis (`stack-demo/` becomes able to run with no `stack-dev/`). Chosen at the 2026-06-15 `/developer-kit:design-roadmap` run.)_
- **v1.9 "storytelling"** (in development, codename changeable until ship) continues the theatre lineage and names the thesis directly: the release is about making the seeded world **tell a story** — declarative *stories*, each with a cast of *heroes* whose verified-skill histories the product surfaces narrate. Chosen by the user at the 2026-06-22 `/developer-kit:design-roadmap` run (over the proposed "method acting" / "dramatis personae").

_Last updated: 2026-06-22 (**v1.9 "storytelling" DESIGNED + PROMOTED** — converted the adversarially-verified
seeding spec [`.agentspace/seeding_gaps.md`] into 5 `section` milestones M34→M38 [Stories & Heroes engine →
verified-skill chain → dashboard → Clerkenstein multi-identity → presenter cockpit]; branch
`release/01.90-storytelling` cut from `main`. Backlog unchanged: M33 ant-academy liveness [repro-first],
DEF-M10-01, DEF-M21-01, M25-D9 — all orthogonal to v1.9. The `wip/clerkenstein-browser-login` branch is now
homed in v1.9 M37. Prior: 2026-06-15 v1.8 "understudy" SHIPPED [tag `v1.8`].)_
